Reference markers for batch correction are typically selected based on their biological relevance and technical reproducibility, such as markers that are commonly used to identify cell types or functional states. These markers should be consistently expressed across all batches and not be affected by batch effects. Commonly used reference markers include CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD19 in human blood samples.
